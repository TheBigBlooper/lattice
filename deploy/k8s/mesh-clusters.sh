# Stands up THREE kind clusters, one per baseline, so the mesh can be exercised across real
# cluster boundaries rather than on one flat network.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Three baselines already federate, but delivery_model.md records the gap
# precisely: they sit on one flat Docker network and resolve each other by Docker DNS, so no
# announcement or federation link has ever crossed a routing boundary. The compose stack
# (deploy/docker/mesh-harness.sh) remains where the topology is exercised day to day; this is
# where ADDRESSING is proven.
#
# HOW CLUSTERS REACH EACH OTHER. Every kind node is a Docker container and they all join one
# user-defined bridge network called `kind`, which carries Docker's embedded DNS. So a pod in
# hub-east egresses through its own node and dials hub-central's node container by name, on a
# NodePort:
#
#   broker pod (hub-east) -> node hub-east -> kind bridge -> hub-central-control-plane:<nodePort>
#
# That is a genuine boundary between separate Kubernetes clusters, which is the thing that has
# never been crossed - and it needs no hosting provider, so locked #56 stays deferred rather
# than being forced.
#
# HOST PORTS ARE ALL BELOW 49152, deliberately. Windows auto-reserves blocks from the ephemeral
# range (49152-65535) during uptime, and a reserved block fails the bind with a permissions
# error on the next container recreate - intermittent, and expensive to diagnose because a
# running container keeps working indefinitely after the reservation appears.
#
#   ./deploy/k8s/mesh-clusters.sh up        create all three
#   ./deploy/k8s/mesh-clusters.sh down      delete all three
#   ./deploy/k8s/mesh-clusters.sh status    what exists, and whether the nodes can see each other
